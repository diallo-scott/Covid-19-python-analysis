# Assessing Impact of Covid 19 on US Counties using Python Analysis
Covid-19 is a global pandemic that has had an unprecedented impact of global health and economics.  The virus has spread quickly throughout the US and it has been important for both federal and local governments to take measures to protect their population.  Given the importance of monitorting the spread of the virus and slowing down the rates of infection and death, it is important that we are able to identify which areas of the US are most at risk.  We can accomplish this by using the data that we have already and performing analysis using Python.
